    "There are several types of ensemble methods, and Random Forest is a prominent example of an ensemble method. Some common types of ensemble methods include:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Bagging**: Bagging stands for Bootstrap Aggregating. It involves training multiple models on random subsets of the training data and then aggregating their predictions. Random Forest is a specific implementation of bagging that uses decision trees as base models.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Boosting**: Boosting aims to improve the performance of weak base models by sequentially training new models that focus on the misclassified data points from the previous models. Popular boosting algorithms include AdaBoost and Gradient Boosting.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Voting**: In this approach, multiple models are trained independently, and the final prediction is made by a majority vote (classification) or averaging (regression) of the individual model predictions. Voting ensembles can combine models of different types."
