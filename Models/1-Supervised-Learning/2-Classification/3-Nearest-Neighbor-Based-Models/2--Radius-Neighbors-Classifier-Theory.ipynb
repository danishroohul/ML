    "\n",
    "1. **Proximity-Based Classification:** The fundamental idea of the Radius Neighbors Classifier is that data points belonging to the same class tend to be close to each other. It classifies a new data point by considering the proximity (distance) of this point to its neighboring data points within a defined radius.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Distance Metrics:** The algorithm uses distance metrics, such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance, to measure the proximity between data points. These metrics quantify how similar or dissimilar data points are with respect to their features.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Radius Definition:** Unlike k-Nearest Neighbors (K-NN), which considers the k nearest neighbors regardless of distance, the Radius Neighbors Classifier focuses on a specific radius, which can adapt to the local data distribution. Data points outside this radius are not considered in the classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Majority Voting:** Once the neighbors within the radius are identified, the classifier employs a majority voting mechanism to assign a class label to the new data point. In other words, the class label is determined by the class that is most prevalent among the nearby data points."
