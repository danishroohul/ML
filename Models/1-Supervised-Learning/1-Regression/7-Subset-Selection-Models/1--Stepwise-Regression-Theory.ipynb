However, not all features are created equal, and including irrelevant or redundant features in a regression model can lead to overfitting, increased complexity, and reduced interpretability. This is where feature selection techniques, like Stepwise Regression, become invaluable."

By iteratively adding or removing features based on a chosen criterion, the algorithm may fit the model too closely to the training data, capturing noise rather than true patterns. It is essential to employ strategies like cross-validation and regularization to mitigate this risk.\n",
    "\n",

Small changes in the dataset or criteria may result in a substantially different set of selected features, leading to model instability.\n",

    "3. **No Guarantees of Optimal Model:** Stepwise Regression may not always find the best possible model.
