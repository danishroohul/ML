    "Linear regression is a powerful and widely used technique for modeling relationships between a dependent variable (the target) and one or more independent variables (features or predictors). However, not all features are created equal, and including irrelevant or redundant features in a regression model can lead to overfitting, increased complexity, and reduced interpretability. This is where feature selection techniques, like Stepwise Regression, become invaluable."

    "1. **Forward Selection:** In this step, we start with an empty model and iteratively add the most promising features one at a time based on a predefined criterion, such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC), Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC), or adjusted R-squared. The algorithm continues adding features until no more improvements can be made.\n",

    "2. **Backward Elimination:** After adding features, the algorithm may switch to backward elimination. It starts with a model that includes all features and, in each step, removes the least valuable features based on the chosen criterion. This process continues until the selected features are optimized."

    "**2. Increased Complexity:** As the number of features grows, the complexity of the model increases. Complex models may become difficult to interpret and explain.\n",
